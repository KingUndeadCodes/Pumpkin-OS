### Pumpkin-OS ###

```
This is just a simple "toy" OS I make in my free time.
This project has ONLY been tested with a Virtual Machine (QEMU).
```

Note:
- The **16 bit version is a joke**. The **32-bit version** is the one which **I will continue to build**.

Compiling: 
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/KingUndeadCodes/Pumpkin-OS.git
$ bash etc/ingredients.sh
$ cd Pumpkin-OS/32-bit
$ bash build.sh
```
